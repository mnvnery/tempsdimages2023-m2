synopsis: “Trans*performatividade&quot; (Trans*Performativity) is a project that
  consists of transposing trans* experiences into contemporary practices that
  merge the sharing of stories with collective performances. The movement
  subjectively represents processes of transformation and metamorphosis, the
  scenography proposes an innovative and safe space, the costumes weave
  individual and collective identity and the light design gives visibility to
  under-represented issues, letting the audience perceive, understand and
  participate freely.
