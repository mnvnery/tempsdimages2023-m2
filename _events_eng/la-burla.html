synopsis: "<p>La Burla is a choreographic fiction that follows two figures living
  in a dystopian reality. The encounter between the sacred and the profane takes shape
  in rituals and invocations of entities that emerge from the depths. Deities, witches,
  seers, devils, monsters and heroines cross the imaginary of this piece that investigates
  the relationship between choreography and fiction, activating and incorporating
  a medieval iconographic repertoire. Two performers on an electric yellow carpet
  rely on their imagination, bodies and voices to create this musical choreographic
  fiction.</p><p><br></p>"

    the Fórum Dança Advanced Program of Creation in Performing Arts II (Lisbon), curated
    by Sofia Dias &amp; Vítor Roriz. Their artistic research deals with the notions
    of fiction, archive and performance within the fields of choreography and dramaturgy.
    La Burla, which premiered in 2022 at Festival Transborda (PT), is the first dance
    piece they created together. They also develop independent artistic projects and
    have collaborated with different artists, such as: Miguel Pereira, Sofia Dias
