synopsis: Evocation of the artistic and cinematic expression of 1960s and 1970s’
  public television in Italy. It is the early age of public broadcasting, during
  which cinema also questions its relation to reality and video art emerges as
  an experimental answer. The character, a young female viewer, committed to
  exploring and trying out a new medium, carries us through time. Blurring the
  lines between document and creation, the film places the viewer between the
  early age period of television and the period of time she spends in the room,
  between memory and imagination, utopia and experimentation.
