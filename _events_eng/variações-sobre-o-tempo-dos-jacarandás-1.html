  Performance/ Installation.

  In this creation we work with the oneiric universe, delving into the  mystery and power of the unconscious. We focus on the relationship between the video installation and the bodies of the performers. It is an exploration based on the idea of repetition and continuity as if it were a dream, as if time were suspended.
