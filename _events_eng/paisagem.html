synopsis: "<p><em>PAISAGEM </em>(Landscape) is based on the current contemporary context,
  (in)directly characterized by relational models where violence is the protagonist.
  The scenic mechanism suggests the idea of a laboratory where, in constant tension
  and predictable implosion, two bodies repeat a duet that never happens.</p><p><br></p>"
