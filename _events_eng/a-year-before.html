synopsis: >
  LOBA is a multidisciplinary solo born from the desire to explore women&#39;s
  narratives as they journey into adulthood, embracing themes of sexuality,
  fantasy, and transformation. It is a performance that draws from the

  power of imagery, symbols, and memories. In the video, we see a body dancing in a forest and racing against a wolf.

  On stage, this same body is meticulously preparing to dance. Sensuality is pursued without fear of the grotesque. Eventually, reality merges with fiction, and only then, in a surreal lucid dream shrouded in fog, the she-wolf is born, and she kills the wolf.
