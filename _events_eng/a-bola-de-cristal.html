synopsis: >-
  “A Bola de Cristal” (The Crystal Ball) holds memories of a mother who passed
  away, a Portuguese woman called Rosário (1950-2009) who left behind more than
  30 diaries and a captive place at the Bingo Parlour.

  Represented by three characters, and based on the triptych “mãe-mulher- Rosário” (mother - woman - Rosário), this performance will transform the numbers in the tombola into memories. A tragi-comic and unrepeatable game (like life), were the desire — more than shouting &quot;bingo!&quot; — is to reflect on loss as a universal feeling.
