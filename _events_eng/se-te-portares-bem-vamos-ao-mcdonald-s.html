synopsis: "<p>As of today, everyone has the possibility to recruit a person to cater
  to their wishes, desires, and dreams. The brother you always wanted to have? That
  grandpa who’s already gone, and to whom you would you like to give one last hug?
  Are you single, but want to take someone as an escort to a wedding? Now it is possible.
  In our company, we have people ready and available to personify everything you need.
  The only rule: life cannot be put at risk.</p><p><br></p>"
