synopsis: >
  &#39;X&#39; and &#39;Y&#39; are the axes of the plot which unfolds under the
  watchful eye of

  &#39;Z&#39;. In an ethereal realm, two people find themselves adrift, assisting each

  other in their quest to find a way out.

  In this specific place it is difficult to decipher and envision the outside

  world, as the primary focus lies in embodying and expressing what resides

  within—everything that remains unseen and is often misconstrued by

  human beings.

  Despite the potential discomfort it may cause, it is essential to bring

  certain stigmatized and disregarded plights into the realm of

  consciousness.
