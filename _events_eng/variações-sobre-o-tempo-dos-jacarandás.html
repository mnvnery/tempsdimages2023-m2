synopsis: >
  “Variações sobre o tempo dos jacarandás&quot; (Variations on the season of the
  jacaranda trees) is the first collaboration between Yaw Tembe and Sofia
  Dinger. The piece revolves around a dialogue with the image of a

  tree observed through a window and is structured into two distinct seasons: in the first, presented this autumn, the tree devoid of blossoms.

  “Variações…” draws its inspiration from an old song that talks about doors, hearts, people passing by, houses. A song that has the words: Simply and Love. A woman sings for a long time. The sound of the trumpet sounds like something eerie. The flowers are indecisive.
