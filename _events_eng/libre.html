synopsis: "<p><em>LEBRE - Lances de Hermes is a creation that sees the word as image-time,
  from philosophical hip-hop and cabaret theatre to digital citizens. The project
  takes as its starting point the idea that we are in an era of velocity and communicability,
  which are attributes of the mythological Hermes; seen from another perspective,
  the LEBRE is a diagnosis of hermetic inflation, in Western contemporary culture,
  subject to manipulation of information, dissolution of values, the commodification
  of culture and the arts. Alexandre Pieroni Calado and João Ferro Martins revisit
  the Greek-Latin tradition to reflect on the present time, a work they had already
  initiated in O Declive e a Inclinação – Fragmentos do mito de Sísifo e A Morte nos
  Olhos – sobre o mito de Perseu e Medusa. The new creation, Lebre – Lances de Hermes,
  is an oratory-Downtempo that creatively investigates the ambiguous ascendant of
  Hermes in our time, especially the compulsive dynamism and the accelerated dispersion
  of regimens of truth.</em></p><p><br></p>"
