synopsis: >
  In an online conference, André Lepécki contextualised the process that leads
  to the disappearance of the body. We were in the midst of a pandemic and,
  under those circumstances, this disappearance was also literal. As technology
  reshapes today&#39;s societies, the human body gradually fades into the
  background, overshadowed by the processes inherent to our interconnected
  world. The vertigo induced by the structures of life in the digital age,
  strongly influenced by attention capitalism, is as inevitable as the
  technology-driven changes, stemming from the dematerialization of many
  fundamental aspects of existence, reshaping our societies.

  In the torrent of an exposed, increasingly fragmented life, with fragile bonds and managed from a distance, the body carves out its own space by asserting itself as a vessel for listening—a poetic gesture that seeks to offer protection to us all.
