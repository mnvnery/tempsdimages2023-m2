    Which one of these matters the most: what we say or what we do?


    What relevance does a text "about" TdI have, when compared to this year’s festival programme? 


    In our opinion, the pieces we present speak louder than our words.


    Each one of them has a voice, the result of valuable dedication and investment that only appears as a consequence of remarkable determination, shared risks, linked to various goals, never comfortable, never resigned.


    To be clear:  it is not the financial contribution of our festival that makes these works come to light; they only reach the public because there is a great (huge) alignment / cohesion of wills to make them possible, starting with the wish and the commitment of those who propose them – the artists and their teams - who, from the outset, and recognizing a journey and mission that already have 20 years on the road, bring their proposals to us.


    Subsequently, aware that we propose a festival that mainly presents pieces / plays (regardless of pre-established themes or expectations/prejudices towards the previous careers of the authors and their goals), and since we work with public funding, we are concerned with clarifying out domain.


    We increasingly assert ourselves as a festival that focuses on the intersection between Live Art — presupposing a meeting between the artistic object and the audience in a shared time and space — (and the issues surrounding the) Image \[in a broad sense]. We do not intend to define themes, agendas, or stances / viewpoints / points of view. 


    Our intention is, indeed, to have our doors open to what interests the artists as work objects. We intend to defend diversity and contradiction, we intend to contribute to defending risk and experimentation, the unusual and the alternative.


    Our intention is to make possible what would not be feasible otherwise, and we work to generate interest, to provoke the engagement of the audiences of the capital city of this country with what the artists propose.


    We are fully aware that our proposal is not only ours: it only exists because it is shared. We do not have a venue: we present what others want to present with us. Whether it be the authors or the venues that host our programs, year after year, proving that the city is alive and still to be discovered.


    Let’s say that, for a "historical" reason, our festival has a French name: we care less about how it is pronounced; we care more about what is done.
